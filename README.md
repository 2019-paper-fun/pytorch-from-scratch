# PyTorch From Scratch

The notebook in this repo accompanies my Medium article, ["Building Your First Neural Net From Scratch WithÂ PyTorch"](https://medium.com/@tomgrek/building-your-first-neural-net-from-scratch-with-pytorch-56b0e9c84d54).

## Getting Started

You'll need Python 3.6, PyTorch, a working CUDA installation, and Jupyter Notebook.
