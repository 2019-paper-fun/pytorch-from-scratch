# PyTorch From Scratch

The notebooks in this repo accompany my Medium articles:

* ["Building Your First Neural Net From Scratch With PyTorch"](https://medium.com/@tomgrek/building-your-first-neural-net-from-scratch-with-pytorch-56b0e9c84d54).

* ["PyTorch From First Principles: Part II"](https://medium.com/@tomgrek/pytorch-from-first-principles-part-ii-d37529c57a62).

* ["WTF is going on with fast.ai?"](https://medium.com/@tomgrek/wtf-is-going-on-with-fast-ai-db59741b5da2).

## Getting Started

You'll need Python 3.6, PyTorch, a working CUDA installation, and Jupyter Notebook.
